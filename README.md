## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

- React JS development - practice with JSON manipulation, useState hooks
- First time diving into Tailwind CSS - so getting used to utility classes and how to use them - creating CSS a lot faster integrating Tailwind CSS in the HTML markup

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me a lot with getting my head around using all the Taiwlind CSS utility classes - still need a lot of practice
- [Net Ninja Tailwind CSS tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxmDnn7lrnk) - This is an amazing tutorial which was very usefull as I was a beginner in using Tailwind CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
